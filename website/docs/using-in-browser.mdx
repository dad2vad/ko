title: Using in Browser

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

Kosko can be used in browsers via the programmatic API. Currently only `@kosko/env` and `@kosko/generate` packages are browser-ready.

:::note Examples

- [Webpack 5](https://github.com/tommy351/kosko/tree/master/examples/web-webpack-5)
- [Static](https://github.com/tommy351/kosko/tree/master/examples/web-static)
- [Sync Environment](https://github.com/tommy351/kosko/tree/master/examples/web-sync-environment)

:::

## Prerequisites

The browser support was introduced in the following versions. Make sure to update these packages before getting started.

- `@kosko/env` - 2.0.0
- `@kosko/generate` - 1.2.0

## Entry File

`@kosko/env` doesn't come with any default environment loaders in browser. You have to set one manually. This is because bundlers (e.g. Webpack, Parcel) transpile `import` statements and bundlers can't parse dynamic import paths without any contexts. Import paths are much simpler in userland. (`import(path)` v.s. `import("./envs/" + name)`)

Another difference is that you can't use the `generate` function exported from the `@kosko/generate` package. Instead, use the `resolve` function to resolve and validate components. This is because the `generate` function finds matched components with [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>), which is not available in browsers.

Below is a basic example of an entry file. First, we use dynamic import to load environment variables. Then, use the `resolve` function to resolve and validate components. And finally, print the resolved manifests with the `print` function.

```js
import env, { createAsyncLoaderReducers } from "@kosko/env";
import { resolve, print, PrintFormat } from "@kosko/generate";

// Load environment variables with dynamic import
env.setReducers((reducers) => [
  ...reducers,
  ...createAsyncLoaderReducers({
    global: () =>
      import("./environments/dev/index.js").then((mod) => mod.default),
    component: (name) =>
      import(`./environments/dev/${name}.js`).then((mod) => mod.default)
  })
]);

(async () => {
  // Resolve and validate components
  const manifests = await resolve(
    import("./components/nginx.js").then((mod) => mod.default)
  );

  // Print resolved manifests
  print(
    { manifests },
    {
      format: PrintFormat.YAML,
      writer: { write: (data) => console.log(data) }
    }
  );
})();
```

See [API docs](/docs/api) for more details.

## Environments

### Async

`@kosko/env` is asynchronous by default in browser. You **MUST** add `await` when retrieving environment variables.

```js
import env from "@kosko/env";

const globalParams = await env.global();
const componentParams = await env.component("demo");

export default [new Deployment()];
```

However, [top-level await](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-top-level-await) is only available on Webpack 5 and [mainstream browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_await_top_level). If your bundler or browser doesn't support top-level await yet, you must wrap components with an async function.

```js
import env from "@kosko/env";

export default async function () {
  const params = await env.component("demo");

  return [new Deployment()];
}
```

### Sync

:::note Examples

- [Sync Environment](https://github.com/tommy351/kosko/tree/master/examples/web-sync-environment)

:::

The other way is to create a synchronous environment, so you don't have to add `await` when retrieving environment variables.

```js
import { createSyncEnvironment, createSyncLoaderReducers } from "@kosko/env";

const env = createSyncEnvironment();

env.setReducers((reducers) => [
  ...reducers,
  ...createSyncLoaderReducers({
    global: () => {},
    component: (name) => {}
  })
]);

export default env;
```

One caveat is that you can't use dynamic imports in the environment loader anymore. In Webpack, you can use [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/#requirecontext) to import files in a folder.

```js
const dev = require.context("./environments/dev");

env.setReducers((reducers) => [
  ...reducers,
  ...createSyncLoaderReducers({
    global: () => dev("./index"),
    component: (name) => dev(`./${name}`)
  })
]);
```

Another caveat is that you have to rewrite the `@kosko/env` import paths in components, or use aliases.

## Without Bundlers

:::note Examples

- [Static](https://github.com/tommy351/kosko/tree/master/examples/web-static)

:::

Kosko can also be used without a bundler. You can import modules from a CDN that supports ECMAScript modules (e.g. [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/), [JSPM](https://jspm.org/), etc.).

```js
import env from "https://jspm.dev/@kosko/env";
import { Deployment } from "https://jspm.dev/kubernetes-models/apps/v1/Deployment";

const params = await env.component("demo");

export default [new Deployment()];
```

You can also use [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) so you don't have to rewrite import paths. Please note that it is only supported on Chrome (as of April 2021). You might need a polyfill such as [es-module-shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims).

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "@kosko/env": "https://jspm.dev/@kosko/env",
      "@kosko/generate": "https://jspm.dev/@kosko/generate",
      "kubernetes-models/": "https://jspm.dev/kubernetes-models/"
    }
  }
</script>
```
